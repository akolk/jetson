Hints:
- Assumes a **USB mouse**, **USB keyboard**, **HDMI cable** and **monitor** is given as needed for initial boot of the root os.
- Assumes an **existing bare-metal Kubernetes cluster** including an Ethernet switch to connect to - have a look at [Project Max](https://github.com/helmuthva/ceil/tree/max) for how to build one with [mini PCs](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Barebone-System-Components-GB-BACE-3000/dp/B0161UXU5Y) or [Project Ceil](https://github.com/helmuthva/ceil) for the [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) variant.
- Except for injecting the SSD into its enclosure and shortening one jumper (as described below) **no assembly is required**.

## Bootstrap macOS development environment

1) Execute **`make bootstrap-environment`** to install requirements on your macOS device and setup hostnames such as `nano-one.local` in your `/etc/hosts`

Hint:
- During bootstrap you will have to enter the passsword of your user on your macOS device to **allow software installation**
- The system / security settings of your macOS device must [allow](https://www.macworld.com/article/3094865/how-to-run-apps-that-are-not-from-the-app-store-in-macos-sierra.html) installation of software coming **from outside of the macOS AppStore**
- [**`make`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) is used as a facade for all workflows triggered from the development workstation - execute **`make help`** on your macOS device to list all targets and see the `Makefile` in this directory for details
- **Ansible** is used for configuration management on macOS and nano  - all Ansible roles are [**idempotent**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html) thus can be executed repeatedly e.g. after you make changes in the configuration in `workflow/provision/group_vars/all.yml`
- Have a look at `workflow/requirements/macOS/ansible/requirements.yml` for a list of packages and applications installed

## Provision Jetson device and join Kubernetes cluster as node

### Manually flash root os, create `provision` account and automatically establish secure access

1) Execute **`make image-download`** on your macOS device to download and unzip the NVIDIA Jetpack image into `workflow/provision/image/`
2) Start the **`balenaEtcher`** application and flash your micro sd card with the downloaded image
3) Wire the nano up with the ethernet switch of your **Kubernetes cluster**
4) Insert the designated micro sd card in your NVIDIA Jetson nano and **power up**
5) **Create a user account** with username **`provision`** and "Administrator" rights via the UI and set **`nano-one`** as hostname - wait until the login screen appears
6) Execute **`make setup-access-secure`** and enter the password you set for the `provision` user in the step above when asked - passwordless ssh access and sudo will be set up

Hints:
- The `balenaEtcher` application was installed as part of **bootstrap**  - see above
- Step 5 requires to wire up your nano with a USB mouse, keyboard and monitor - after that you can unplug and use the nano with headless access using ssh, VNC, RDP or http
- In case of a Jetson Nano you might experience intermittent operation - make sure to **provide an adequate power supply** - the best option is to put a [Jumper](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07BTB3MC7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on pins J48 and use a [DC barrel jack power supply](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07NSSD9RJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (with 5.5mm OD / 2.1mm ID / 9.5mm length, center pin positive) than can supply 5V with 4A - see [NVIDIA DevTalk](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1048640/jetson-nano/power-supply-considerations-for-jetson-nano-developer-kit/) for a schema of the board layout. 
- Depending on how the DHCP server of your cluster is configured you might have to adapt the IP address of `nano-one.local` in **`workflow/requirements/generic/ansible/playbook.yml`**
- SSH into your nano using **`make nano-one-ssh`** - your ssh public key was uploaded in step 5 above so no password is needed

### Automatically provision tools, services, kernel and Kubernetes on Jetson host

1) Execute **`make k8s-token-create`** to generate a valid join token for your Kubernetes cluster and update  **`kubernetes.token`** in `workflow/provision/group_vars/all.yml`
2) Execute **`make provision`** -  services will provisioned, kernel will be compiled, kubernetes cluster will be joined

Hints:
- As **the Linux kernel is built with requirements for Kubernetes + Weave networking** - such as activating [IP sets](http://ipset.netfilter.org/) and the [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/) datapath module - initial provisioning takes **ca. one hour**
- To easily inspect the Kubernetes cluster execute the lovely **`click`** from the terminal which was installed as part of bootstrap - enter `nodes` to list the nodes with the nano being one of them - see [Click](https://github.com/databricks/click) for details
- VNC into your nano by starting the **VNC Viewer** application which was installed as part of bootstrap and connect to **`nano-one.local:5901`** - the password is `secret`
- If you want to provision **step by step** execute `make help | grep "provision-"` and execute the desired make target e.g. `make provision-kernel`


## Build and deploy services to Kubernetes cluster

1) Execute **`make nano-one-cuda-ml-deb-repack`** *once* to repack libraries bundled with the Jetpack image as deb files such as CUDNN, TensorRT, TensorFlow libraries, python bindings - this will create the repository `/var/cuda-ml-local-repo` on your nano which is used in building the **`jetson/ml-base`** image -  have a look at `workflow/deploy/tools/nano-cuda-ml-deb-repack` for details
2) Execute **`make ml-base-build-and-push`** *once* to build the Docker base image **`jetson/ml-base`** and push to the private registry of your cluster, which, amongst others, includes CUDA, CUDNN, TensorRT, TensorFlow, python bindings and Anaconda - have a look at the directory `workflow/deploy/ml-base` for details - most images below derive from this image
3) Execute **`make device-query-deploy`** to build and deploy a pod into the Kubernetes cluster that **queries CUDA capabilities** thus validating GPU and [Tensor Core](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tensorcore/) access from inside Docker and correct labeling of Jetson/arm64 based Kubernetes nodes - execute `make device-query-log-show` to show the result after deploying
4) Execute **`make jupyter-deploy`** to build and deploy a **Jupyter server** as a Kubernetes pod running on nano supporting CUDA accelerated **TensorFlow + Keras** including support for **Octave** as an alternative Jupyter Kernel in addition to iPython - execute **`make jupyter-open`** to open a browser tab pointing to the Jupyter server to execute the bundled **Tensorflow Jupyter notebooks** for [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
5) Execute **`make tensorflow-serving-deploy`** to build and deploy **TensorFlow Serving** plus a Python/[**Fast API**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) based [Webservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) API for accessing predictions as a Kubernetes pod running on nano - execute **`make tensorflow-serving-open`** to open a browser tab pointing to the Webservice API (wip)

Hints:
- All deployment automatically create **a private Kubernetes namespace** using the pattern `jetson-$deployment` - e.g. `jetson-jupyter` for the Jupyter deployment - thus easing inspection in the [Kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard), `click` or similar
- All deployments provide a **target for deletion** such as `make device-query-delete` which will automatically delete the respective namespace, persistent volumes, pods, services, ingress and loadbalancer on the cluster
- All builds on the nano run as **user `build`** which was created during provisioning - use `make nano-one-ssh-build` to login as user `build` to monitor intermediate results
- Remote building on nano is implemented using **Skaffold** and a custom builder - have a look at `workflow/deploy/device-query/skaffold.yaml` and `workflow/deploy/tools/builder` for the approach
- Skaffold supports a nice [**build, deploy, tail, watch cycle**](https://skaffold.dev/docs/getting-started/) - execute `make device-query-dev` as an example
- Containers mount **device drivers** - such as `usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/tegra/*` as well as devices **`/dev/nv*`** at runtime to access the GPU and Tensor Cores - see `workflow/deploy/device-query/kustomize/base/deployment.yaml` for details
- Kubernetes deployments are defined using **kustomize** - you can thus define kustomize [**overlays**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays) for deployments on other clusters or scale-out easily
- Kustomize overlays can be easily referenced using [**Skaffold profiles**](https://skaffold.dev/docs/how-tos/profiles/)
- Most containers provide targets for [**Container Structure Tests**](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) - execute `make device-query-build-and-test` as an example 
- If you did **not** use **[Project Max](https://github.com/helmuthva/ceil/tree/max)** to provision your bare-metal Kubernetes cluster make sure your cluster provides a DNSMASQ and DHCP server, firewalling, VPN and private Docker registry as well as support for Kubernetes features such as persistent volumes, ingress and loadbalancing as required during build and in deployments - adapt occurrences of the name `max-one` accordingly to wire up with your infrastructure


## Optional: Configure swap

1) Execute **`provision-swap`**

Hints: 
- You can **configure the required swap size** in `workflow/provision/group_vars/all.yml`

## Optional: Boot from USB 3.0 SSD (for advanced users only)

1) **Wire up your SATA SSD** with one of the USB 3.0 ports, unplug all other block devices connected via USB ports and reboot via `make nano-one-reboot`
2) Set the **`ssd.id_serial_short`** of the SSD in `workflow/provision/group_vars` given the info provided by executing **`make nano-one-ssd-id-serial-short-show`**  
3) Execute **`nano-one-ssd-prepare`** to assign the stable device name /dev/ssd, wipe and partition the SSD, create an ext4 filesystem and sync the micro SD card to the SSD
4) Set the **`ssd.uuid`** of the SSD in `workflow/provision/group_vars` given the info provided by executing **`make nano-one-ssd-uuid-show`**  
5) Execute **`nano-one-ssd-activate`** to configure the boot menu to use the SSD as the default boot device and reboot

Hints:
- A SATA SSD connected via USB 3.0 is more durable and typically **faster by a factor of three** relative to a micro sd card - tested using a [WD Blue M.2 SSD](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B073SBV3XX/ref=twister_B07TP4ZYNV?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) versus a [SanDisk Extreme microSD card](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07FCMKK5X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- The micro sd card is mounted as **`/mnt/mmc`** after step 5 in case you want to update the kernel later which now resides in `/mnt/mmc/boot/Image`
- ~~You can **wire up additional block devices via USB** again after step 5 as the UUID is used for referencing the SSD designated for boot~~ (wip)

## Optional: Cross-build Docker images for Jetson on macOS (wip)

1) Execute **`make l4t-deploy`** to cross-build Docker image on macOS using buildkit based on official base image from NVIDIA and deploy - functionality is identical to `device-query` - see above

Hints:
- Have a look at the **custom Skaffold builder for Mac** in `workflow/deploy/l4t/builder.mac` on how this is achieved
- A `daemon.json` switching on **experimental Docker features on your macOS device** required for this was automatically installed as part of bootstrap - see above

## Optional: Setup firewall (wip)

1) Execute **`provision-firewall`**
